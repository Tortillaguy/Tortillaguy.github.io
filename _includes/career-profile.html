    	<h6>Hello!</h6>
		<p>As both a developer and artist, I've been fascinated with mixing code and visuals. I'm a lover of live events and have produced projection mapped displays for settings anywhere from upscale to warehouse. In hackathons and team projects, I excel at designing the front end experience and interactive elements of the application. My favorite software to work with is Unity, Touchdesigner, and ThreeJS; though I often experiment with other applications outside my wheelhouse.</p>
		<!-- <p>My career in media production has built a solid foundation for my understanding of sound, lighting, and video hardware. As an independent contractor, I've produced several interactive installations and AR/VR applications for HMDs as well. My passion is driven from a desire to create memorable experiences that people can share.</p> -->
		<p>I'm always to open to hearing out new opportunities and adventures. If interested, feel free to send a note.</p>

		<i>Thanks for reading :)</i>
