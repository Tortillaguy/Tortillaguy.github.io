### Company Contributions

During my tenure at the company, I collaborated closely with the internal Magic Leap development team to expand the capabilities of the Lumin SDK using C++. This collaboration involved enhancing the SDK's features, which played a crucial role in developing more advanced and immersive AR experiences. My contributions helped push the boundaries of what was possible with the Magic Leap platform, providing a richer toolkit for developers.

### AR/VR Development

I also designed reusable game modules and core system architecture for AR and VR experiences using C# and Unity. These modules served as the foundational building blocks for various interactive applications, ensuring a high level of performance and scalability. By focusing on core architecture, I enabled more efficient development processes and facilitated the creation of complex AR and VR experiences.

### Shader Development

In addition, I built programmable shader effects and animations using HLSL, ShaderLab, and ShaderGraph. These shaders were integral in creating visually stunning and dynamic effects that enhanced the overall user experience.

### Team Leadership

Moreover, I led a team of three peer developers in paired programming sessions, quality assurance, look development optimizations, and feature implementation. This leadership role involved mentoring and coordinating the team to ensure that our development goals were met effectively and efficiently.
