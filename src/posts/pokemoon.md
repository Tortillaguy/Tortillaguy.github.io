### Overview

I led a small, fully remote team consisting of artists, blockchain developers, and marketing professionals on this NFT project. This multidisciplinary team collaborated closely to achieve our goals in the rapidly evolving Web3 space. My leadership ensured that despite being geographically dispersed, the team operated cohesively and efficiently, leveraging our diverse skills to drive innovative projects forward.

### Web3 Sites Design and Development

I designed several Web3 sites aimed at facilitating decentralized exchange (DEX) and NFT marketplace features. These sites were built to provide users with seamless and secure experiences in trading and managing digital assets. By implementing cutting-edge design principles and robust backend solutions, I ensured that our platforms were not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing, thereby enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

### 3D NFTs and Token Launches

In addition, I implemented Three.js and React Three Fiber to create unique 3D NFTs, delivering immersive and interactive digital art experiences. My efforts in this area helped differentiate our NFT offerings in a crowded market. Furthermore, I successfully launched several tokens that were listed on Coingecko and other Binance Smart Chain automated market makers (AMMs). These listings increased our visibility and credibility in the blockchain community, contributing to the overall growth and success of our projects.
