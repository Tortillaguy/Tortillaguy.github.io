    I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer with over 7 years of experience building
    scalable, high-performance web applications and immersive experiences. I've led
    engineering teams to deliver high-impact products including
    <a

      class="text-yellow-300 hover:italic">blocks.glass</a
    > — the first-ever content sharing platform for holograms, serving 100,000+
    digital assets — and Vertebrae, a 3D asset pipeline acquired by Snapchat.
    <br />
    <br />
    My technical expertise spans full-stack development (React, TypeScript, Next.js,
    Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS) and 3D web graphics (Three.js, WebGL). I've optimized
    complex database queries to achieve 70% performance improvements, architected
    payment systems processing thousands of transactions, and integrated AI/ML
    services using RAG techniques with LangChain. I combine strong engineering
    fundamentals with product thinking to deliver solutions that drive both user
    satisfaction and business outcomes.

    <br />
    Notable projects include building a Spotify app for Magic Leap using Unity and
    C++, developing mobile AR experiences for Coachella that reached millions of
    festival attendees, and completing the Polkadot Blockchain Academy to expand
    my expertise into Web3 and distributed systems using Rust and Substrate. As a
    visual artist, I also VJ major events using professional tools like Resolume,
    Disguise, and TouchDesigner, bringing a unique creative perspective to
    technical problem-solving.
