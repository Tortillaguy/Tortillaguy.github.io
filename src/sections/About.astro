    I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer with over 7 years of experience building
    scalable, high-performance web applications and immersive experiences. I've led
    engineering teams to deliver high-impact products including
    <a

      class="text-yellow-300 hover:italic">blocks.glass</a
    > — the first-ever content sharing platform for holograms, serving 100,000+
    digital assets — and Vertebrae, a 3D asset pipeline acquired by Snapchat.
    <br />
    <br />
    My technical expertise spans full-stack development (React, TypeScript, Next.js,
    Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS) and 3D web graphics (Three.js, WebGL). I've optimized
    complex database queries to achieve 70% performance improvements, architected
    payment systems processing thousands of transactions, and integrated AI/ML
    services using RAG techniques. I combine strong engineering fundamentals with
    product thinking to deliver solutions that drive both user satisfaction and
    business outcomes.

    Notable projects include building a Spotify app for Magic Leap using Unity and
    C++, developing mobile AR experiences for Coachella that reached millions of
    festival attendees, and completing the Polkadot Blockchain Academy to expand
    my expertise into Web3 and distributed systems. As a visual artist, I also
    VJ major events using professional tools like Resolume, Disguise, and TouchDesigner,
    bringing a unique creative perspective to technical problem-solving.
