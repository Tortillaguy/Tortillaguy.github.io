### Company Contributions

During my time at the company, I focused on building automated pipelines using AWS, Docker, and Node.js to prepare over 50,000 3D assets for mobile augmented reality (AR) features. This involved creating robust systems that ensured the efficient processing and optimization of 3D models, making them suitable for mobile AR applications. These pipelines were critical in supporting our AR initiatives, enabling us to deliver high-quality, immersive experiences to users.

### Backend Development

I also developed backend features using Postgres and SQL to support digital assets and conversion jobs for over 100 retail vendors. This work was essential in managing and processing large volumes of digital content, ensuring seamless integration and functionality across our platform. By optimizing the backend infrastructure, I contributed to the scalability and reliability of our services, which were vital for maintaining strong partnerships with our retail vendors.

### Frontend Development and Workflow Automation

In addition, I distributed bespoke React applications to support the workflow of several tech artists, utilizing React, Three.js, WebGL, and Electron. This provided a streamlined and efficient toolset for our artists, enhancing their productivity and creativity. Furthermore, I leveraged Blender's Python API and Node.js to automate processes such as decimation, re-meshing, and material re-assignment. This automation significantly reduced manual workload, improved consistency in asset preparation, and accelerated our production timelines.
