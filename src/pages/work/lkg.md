### Summary

During my time at Looking Glass Factory, I played a pivotal role in implementing payment processing services, which were essential for enabling our SaaS products and subscriptions through platforms like Webflow and Shopify. This project involved:

- Ensuring seamless transactions
- Enhancing the user experience
- Providing robust support for recurring billing and subscription management

My work in this area significantly contributed to the company's revenue stream by facilitating smooth and reliable payment processes.

### Liteforms Platform Integration

I integrated large language model (LLM) services into our Liteforms platform, employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for efficient data retrieval among documents. This integration not only improved the platform's functionality but also:

- Enhanced the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval
- Led to better user satisfaction and increased engagement

By leveraging advanced AI techniques, I helped the company stay at the forefront of technological innovation in our industry.

### Design and Development Enhancements

Additionally, I introduced Storybook and mobile-first design principles to our full-stack application. This, along with closer integration with Figma and Tailwind, streamlined our development process and improved design consistency. Key contributions include:

- Supporting the inclusion of 3D renders and animations on the web using framer-motion, three.js, and React Three Fiber, enriching the visual experience for our users
- Designing automated build pipelines for Unity C# code generation using OpenAPI and our Next.js codebase, which enhanced our development efficiency and reduced manual errors, ultimately accelerating our product release cycles
