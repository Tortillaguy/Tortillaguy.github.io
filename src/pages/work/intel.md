### Web Application Development

During my time at the company, I managed teams of developers in building a comprehensive CMS web application using PHP, jQuery, and Angular. This role involved overseeing the entire development process, from planning to execution, ensuring that the team met project deadlines and maintained high standards of code quality. My leadership was pivotal in delivering a robust and user-friendly CMS that catered to our clients' needs.

### Virtual Reality (VR) Development

I also developed and enhanced VR features within Unity, working across multiple platforms including Android, iOS, and Windows using C#. This work was essential in expanding our VR offerings and improving the overall user experience.

### UX/UI Design and Automation

In addition to development, I designed UX, UI, and user stories for both VR and full-stack web applications, ensuring that our products were intuitive and engaging for users. Leveraging AWS tools, I automated content pipelines between several backend frameworks, which streamlined our processes and improved efficiency. I also automated transcode jobs for VR content using Python and FFmpeg to ensure compatibility across various social media platforms. This automation was crucial in maintaining high-quality VR content distribution and reducing manual workload, thereby enhancing our team's productivity and output.
