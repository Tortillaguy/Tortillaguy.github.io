### Company Contributions

During my tenure at the company, I made significant contributions to the development of new full-stack features, which catered to over 1,000 daily active users (DAU). I focused on optimizing our ORM using GraphQL, Postgres, and Node.js, ensuring efficient data management and robust backend performance. These enhancements were crucial in maintaining high user engagement and delivering a seamless experience for our growing user base.

### Frontend Development

On the frontend, I built reusable components and data stores using React, Redux, and TypeScript, which streamlined the development process and improved code maintainability. My collaboration with the Head of Design was instrumental in creating a cohesive brand system and UI/UX patterns for our Web3 initiatives, using Figma. This effort ensured a consistent and intuitive user interface, aligning with our strategic goals to innovate within the Web3 space.

### Build Pipelines and Automation

Additionally, I designed and developed build pipelines with Rollup for several Next.js applications and Storybook, enhancing our deployment efficiency. I automated continuous integration pipelines using Docker, GitHub Actions, NPM, and Yarn scripts, which significantly reduced manual intervention and accelerated our release cycles.

### Web3 Integration

Furthermore, I integrated Web3 libraries such as web3-react, web3.js, and ethers.js to facilitate NFT purchases, thereby expanding our platform's capabilities and positioning us competitively in the blockchain technology market.
